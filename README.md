**Cosmac Assembler** provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for the **RCA Cosmac 1802**.


## Language Support

Note that there are (at least) two different Cosmac assembler syntaxes. This extension supports:
- Comments initiated by "..".
- The DC mnemonic rather than DB.
- A.0() and A.1() to specify the high or low byte of a 16-bit address, versus LOW and HIGH.

Static completions are supported, but no dynamic completions at this point.
